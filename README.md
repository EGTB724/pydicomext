# pydicomext

This module provides additional functionality to the *pydicom* Python package. Specifically, it adds the ability to load entire DICOM directories, organize based on patients, studies or series, combine series into multidimensional volumes and much more.

As of now, I do not feel comfortable releasing this project on PyPi because it is in a beta stage. However, this code is used in multiple projects and I did not want to manage multiple copies of the code. 

The intended use of this repository is to create a Git submodule to this repository and include the code in your Python project.
